## 🧑‍💻 About Me  
I’m a big nerd who loves breaking and fixing things until they work better.  
My happy place? Somewhere between **electronics** and **code** — preferably when it’s **open-source**.  

- 🐧 Linux is my daily playground (Arch + Hyprland 💜)  
  (Yes, Hyprland for daily use. No, I’m not okay. Yes, I’m insane.)  
- ⚡ Arduino tinkerer — currently building MCU stuff for fun (and chaos)  
- 📡 Eager to learn **embedded systems**, **SBCs**, and *anything with blinking LEDs*  
- 💻 Languages I actually know: `C`, `Java`, `JavaScript`   
- 🔭 Exploring: low-level programming, IoT, and electronics projects  
- ❤️ Firm believer in the open-source way: share, break, fix, repeat

- Focusing on Embedded systems  
- Learning Flutter like it’s my side-quest 🕹️  
- Writing code that makes hardware do silly but useful things  
- Dreaming about building something awesome with SBCs  
- Diving deeper into open-source and contributing wherever I can
